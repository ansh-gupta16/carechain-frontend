A blockchain-inspired (but not on-chain) web app where users can anonymously or openly request help, and others can fulfill those requests transparently and with accountability.

Think of it like a mix of:

Redditâ€™s r/Assistance

Mutual aid bulletin board

With lightweight "trust points" system

ðŸ§  What Makes It Creative & Stand Out
Focus on decentralized, peer-to-peer assistance.

Users can request help anonymously (privacy-focused).

Aid fulfillment is tracked with a visible history of contributions.

Can be used in colleges, disaster zones, or urban communities.
